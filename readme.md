## CAPTCHA solver (for `tsdaucap.hanoi.gov.vn`)
### Auto
> Special thanks to [@4pii4](https://github.com/4pii4) for writing the CAPTCHA solver script.    

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This external script requires `tesseract` to be installed on your machine. Please install it by [downloading it here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) and modify the 18th line in `pytesshost.py` to point it to the executable file.  
> `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = "<TESSERACT EXECUTABLE PATH>" `

`python pytesshost.py`, then configure the `captcha_solver` endpoint. It should automatically solve the CAPTCHAs fed from the scraper script.

### Manual
> Recommended for fastest scraping speed      
On firstrun, it will generate a CAPTCHA in `tempcaptcha.json`. Solve it, and it shouldn't bother you again.     
This is possible due to an oversight in their shitty website.
> Sample `tempcaptcha.json`:
```
{
   "time": ".....",
   "input": "..."
}
```

## Configuration
Edit the `config.json` file accordingly to suit your needs.

 - `delay`  
    + `normal`: delay for each success query.  
    + `fail`: delay for each failed query. (ex. empty record, request timeout, wrong CAPTCHA, etc.)
 - `data_collection`
    + `start`: The first student ID to query and iterate up.
    + `end`: The final student ID to query and stop the program.
 - `output`: The name of the file the program is going to store data into.
 - `mode`: The method that the program is going to scrape.  
    + Available modes: `hanoimoi`, `tsdaucap`
 - `captcha_solver`: The CAPTCHA solver endpoint (for `tsdaucap` mode)
 - `captcha_mode`: Specify how to bypass the CAPTCHA (for `tsdaucap` mode)
    + Available modes: `AUTO`, `MANUAL`

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q:** Massive gaps in the dataset / delays in which no new data are added  
**A:** Blame [S·ªü Gi√°o d·ª•c v√† ƒê√†o t·∫°o th√†nh ph·ªë H√† N·ªôi (https://hanoi.edu.vn/)](https://hanoi.edu.vn/) for this issue, not me.  
They had made it so there are gaps in the dataset, in which students' IDs don't continuously increase step by step.

**Q:** The scores returned `undefined` partially!  
**A:** ~~Uncomplete result (either the student has skipped that exam/no exam submitted)~~. Solved. From now on it will be treated as `0`.

**Q:** Why did you do this?  
**A:** Educational purposes. Looking at the data and graphs is fun.   
On a more serious note, I think this shouldn't stress the servers in any noticable or impactful/harmful way.

## TODOs
 - [x] CSV output, sanitized bad/empty responses
 - [x] CAPTCHA bypass for [tsdaucap](https://tsdaucap.hanoi.gov.vn).
 - [x] Headers and cookies spoofed for tsdaucap     
 - [ ] WebUI   
 - [ ] Automatically detects and skip gaps of empty entries in order to save bandwith
